  h2 Round 3

  p Now there is some proper adventuring to do!! A treasure has been dropped on the plainâ€¦ your task is to determine if you got it! (when you travel over it, you automatically pick it up)

  p The question server will provide:
    pre
      code.
          {
            startX: ~integer~
            startY: ~integer~
            instructions: ~string~
            treasureX: ~integer~
            treasureY: ~integer~
          }

  p The answer will expect:
    pre
      code.
        {
          endX: ~integer~
          endY: ~integer~
          treasureFound: ~boolean~
        }
